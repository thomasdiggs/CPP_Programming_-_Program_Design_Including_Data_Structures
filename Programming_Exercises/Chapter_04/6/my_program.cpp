/* C++ Programming: Program Design Including Data Structures
 * Chapter 4, Programming Exercise 6
 *
 *
 * A box of cookies can hold 24 cookies, and a container can hold 75
 * boxes of cookies. Write a program that prompts the user to enter
 * the total number of cookies, the number of cookies in a box, and the
 * number of cookie boxes in a container. The program then outputs the
 * number of boxes and the number of containers to ship the cookies.
 * Note that each box must contain the specified number of cookies, and
 * each container must contain the specified number of boxes. If the last
 * box of cookies contains less than the number of specified cookies, you
 * can discard it and output the number of leftover cookies. Similarly, if
 * the last container contains less than the number of specified boxes,
 * you can discard it and output the number of leftover boxes.
