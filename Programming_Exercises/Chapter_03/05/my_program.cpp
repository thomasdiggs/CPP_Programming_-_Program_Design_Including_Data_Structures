/* C++ Programming: Program Design Including Data Structures
 * Chapter 3, Programming Exercise 5
 *
 *
 * Three employees in a company are up for a special pay increase. You
 * are given a file, say Ch3_Ex5Data.txt, with the following data:
 * 
 * Miller Andrew 65789.87 5
 * Green Sheila 75892.56 6
 * Sethi Amit 74900.50 6.1
 *
 * Each input line consists of an employeeâ€™s last name, first name, current
 * salary, and percent pay increase. For example, in the first input line,
 * the last name of the employee is Miller, the first name is Andrew,
 * the current salary is 65789.87, and the pay increase is 5%. Write a
 * program that reads data from the specified file and stores the output
 * in the file Ch3_Ex5Output.dat. For each employee, the data must be
 * output in the following form: firstName lastName updatedSalary.
 * Format the output of decimal numbers to two decimal places.
