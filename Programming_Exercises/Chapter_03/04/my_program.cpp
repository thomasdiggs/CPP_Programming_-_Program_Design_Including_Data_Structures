 * Chapter 3, Programming Exercise 4

 *
 * During each summer, John and Jessica grow vegetables in their back-
 * yard and buy seeds and fertilizer from a local nursery. The nursery
 * carries different types of vegetable fertilizers in various bag sizes.
 * When buying a particular fertilizer, they want to know the price of
 * the fertilizer per pound and the cost of fertilizing per square foot. The
 * following program prompts the user to enter the size of the fertilizer
 * bag, in pounds, the cost of the bag, and the area, in square feet, that
 * can be covered by the bag. The program should output the desired
 * result. However, the program contains logic errors. Find and correct
 * the logic errors so that the program works properly.
 *
 *     //Logic errors.
 * 
 *     #include <iostream>
 *     #include <iomanip>
 * 
 *     using namespace std;
 * 
 *     int main()
 *     {
 *         double cost;
 *         double area;
 *
 *         double bagSize;
 * 
 *         cout << fixed << showpoint << setprecision(2);
 *
 *         cout << "Enter the amount of fertilizer, in pounds, "
 *         << "in one bag: ";
 *         cin >> bagSize;
 *         cout << endl;
 *
 *         cout << "Enter the cost of the " << bagSize
 *         << " pound fertilizer bag: ";
 *         cin >> cost;
 *         cout << endl;
 * 
 *         cout << "Enter the area, in square feet, that can be "
 *         << "fertilized by one bag: ";
 *         cin >> area;
 *         cout << endl;
 *
 *         cout << "The cost of the fertilizer per pound is: $"
 *         << bagSize / cost << endl;
 *         cout << "The cost of fertilizing per square foot is: $"
 *         << area / cost << endl;
 *
 *         return 0;
