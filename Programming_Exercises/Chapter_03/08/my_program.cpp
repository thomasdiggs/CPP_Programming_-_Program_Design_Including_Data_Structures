 * Chapter 3, Programming Exercise 8
 *
 *
 * Linda is starting a new cosmetic and clothing business and would like
 * to make a net profit of approximately 10% after paying all the expenses,
 * which include merchandise cost, store rent, employeesâ€™ salary, and
 * electricity cost for the store. She would like to know how much the
 * merchandise should be marked up so that after paying all the expenses
 * at the end of the year she gets approximately 10% net profit on the mer-
 * chandise cost. Note that after marking up the price of an item she would
 * like to put the item on 15% sale. Write a program that prompts Linda
 * to enter the total cost of the merchandise, the salary of the employees
 * (including her own salary), the yearly rent, and the estimated electric-
 * ity cost. The program then outputs how much the merchandise should
 * be marked up so that Linda gets the desired profit.
