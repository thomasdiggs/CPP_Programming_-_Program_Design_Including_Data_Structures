 * Two cars A and B leave an intersection at the same time. Car A Â­ travels
 * west at an average speed of x miles per hour and car B travels south at
 * an average speed of y miles per hour. Write a program that prompts the
 * user to enter the average speed of both the cars and the elapsed time
 * (in hours and minutes) and outputs the (shortest) distance between
 * the cars.
