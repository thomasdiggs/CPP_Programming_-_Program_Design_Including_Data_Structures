 * Newtonâ€™s law states that the force, F, between two bodies of masses and 2
 * M is given by:
 * 
 * F = k * (m1 * m2 / d^2)
 * 
 * in which k is the gravitational constant and d is the distance between the
 * bodies. The value of k is approximately 6.67e-8 dyn. cm^2/g^2. Write
 * a program that prompts the user to input the masses of the bodies and
 * the distance between the bodies. The program then outputs the force
 * between the bodies.
